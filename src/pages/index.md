  reason1:
    belief: Emotional pain is real
    description1: "Alopecia isn’t deadly, but it does kill confidence, perceived identity, and emotional well-being — especially for children, women, and young adults. It can appear at any age and affects all races and sexes."
    description2: >-
      Support plays a big part in helping people with Alopecia regain their
      confidence, maintain a positive outlook, and overcome the emotional pain caused by this autoimmune disease.
  reason2:
    belief: No safe treatment exists
    description1: "The best treatments are far from good. From acidic ointments to powerful pills to steroidal injections, current treatment options often bring serious side effects and are rarely effective."
    description2: >-
      With more funding for research, we hope that our treatment options become
      more effective and less detrimental. 
  reason3:
    belief: 'Big impact, little attention'
    description1: >-
      Alopecia affects 145 million individuals—that's 2% of the population! But very
      few people actually know what Alopecia is. That’s often because people
      with Alopecia feel they can’t discuss it and have to hide it with wigs,
      hats, and makeup to feel accepted. 
    description2: >-
      With increased public awareness of Alopecia, those living with the
      condition will be able to find acceptance.

      In August of 2019, Skylar set south on his Suzuki TU250x motorcycle to ride 20,000+ miles down the
      Pan-American Highway through Central and South America to Patagonia. Along the way, Skylar worked with Adventures for Alopecia to:

      The trip was planned to take 9 months, but took nearly 3.5 years to complete, largely due to COVID-19. On December 13th 2022, Skylar reached the final destination of Ushuaia, Argentina, and the adventure was complete.
    goal1: Sponsor support events for Latin Americans with Alopecia along the way where possible
    goal2: Raise awareness and educate the public about Alopecia through social media, word of mouth, and press.
    goal3: Raised funds to support the above efforts and to contribute to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.naaf.org/research" rel="noopener">NAAF's Treatment Development Program</a>.
