    Washington, D.C. to the southern tip of Argentina in an effort to
    improve the lives of those who have lost their hair and perceived identity to
    the autoimmune disease Alopecia.

  reason1:
    belief: Emotional pain is real
    description1: "Alopecia isn’t deadly, but it does kill confidence, perceived identity, and emotional well-being — especially for children, women, and young adults. It can appear at any age and affects all races and sexes."
    description2: >-
      Support plays a big part in helping people with Alopecia regain their
      confidence, maintain a positive outlook, and overcome the emotional pain caused by this autoimmune disease.
  reason2:
    belief: No safe treatment exists
    description1: "The best treatments are far from good. From acidic ointments to powerful pills to steroidal injections, current treatment options often bring serious side effects and are rarely effective."
    description2: >-
      With more funding for research, we hope that our treatment options become
      more effective and less detrimental. 
  reason3:
    belief: 'Big impact, little attention'
    description1: >-
      Alopecia affects 145 million individuals—that's 2% of the population! But very
      few people actually know what Alopecia is. That’s often because people
      with Alopecia feel they can’t discuss it and have to hide it with wigs,
      hats, and makeup to feel accepted. 
    description2: >-
      With increased public awareness of Alopecia, those living with the
      condition will be able to find acceptance.
