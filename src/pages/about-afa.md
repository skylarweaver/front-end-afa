    Adventures for Alopecia is a nonprofit organization supporting children and adults living with Alopecia.  We
    achieve our mission through three main program areas: support, awareness, and research.  


    Our **support** program will consist of hosting support group events

    throughout North, Central, and South America.  

    Our **awareness** program aims to educate the public about Alopecia through social media, press, word of

    mouth, and speaking engagements.  

    For our **research** efforts, we will partner with the existing 501(c)(3)

    nonprofit organization NAAF to sponsor their existing Alopecia Research

    Development Program.  


    In the future, we hope to sponsor adventures for other people afflicted by

    Alopecia so they can regain confidence through travel and adventure.

  definition1: >
    Alopecia is a common autoimmune skin disease, causing rapid, unpredictable hair loss on the scalp, face, and sometimes the entire body. Over six million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with it, and an individual's lifetime risk of Alopecia is 2.1%. 
  definition2: >
    People of all ages, both sexes, and all ethnic groups can develop Alopecia. It can first appear during childhood or adulthood, and though physically benign, Alopecia can have devastating effects on one’s mental, emotional, and social wellbeing.

      Having long, blonde hair all throughout his youth, Skylar was 
      diagnosed with Alopecia when he was 16 after finding a dime-sized bald spot on the back of his head.
      Six months later, Skylar had become completely bald—a unique look for a sophomore in high school. That uncontrolled transition took a toll on Skylar's emotional well-being and self-confidence throughout high school. 
      Over the past 9 years, Skylar has embraced his Alopecia and has learned to recognize it as an important
      part of his identity. He's also realized that many other like him are trying to overcome similar challenges. Now, Skylar is embarking on the
      adventure of his dreams to demonstrate that Alopecia is not an inhibitor and to
      encourage other Alopecians to own their identity as well.

      Since going completely bald at age 19 due to Alopecia Areata, Kate has rocked a multitude of hairstyles from bald to buzz to curly bob. From a childhood with long curly hair and a competitive Irish Dancing career with a wig wearing requirement, Kate learned early on about societal pressures around appearance. Her journey to accept a lack of control over her hair, her self-image, and how others view her is a work in progress, but a fulfilling one. Due to the variability of Alopecia Areata over time, there may come a day when Kate (and many others like her) loses her hair again. Whether she’s bald or auditioning for a Pantene commercial, she is ultimately stronger and more self-confident having experienced Alopecia and hopes that the support offered by AFA will propel others like her to live life to the max.
