    <b>Support.</b> We host support group events throughout North America, Central America, and South America.  

    <b>Awareness.</b> We educate the public about Alopecia through social media, press, word of mouth, and speaking engagements.  

    <b>Research.</b> We contribute a portion of the funds we raise to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, an existing 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to discovering a cure for Alopecia.

  definition1: >
    Alopecia Areata is a common autoimmune skin disease, that causes rapid, unpredictable hair loss on the scalp, face, and sometimes the entire body. With both genetic and environmental components to Alopecia, no one knows exactly what causes or triggers it. Over six million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with it, and an individual's lifetime risk of Alopecia is 2.1%.
  definition2: >
    People of all ages, sexes, and ethnic groups can develop Alopecia. It can first appear during childhood or adulthood, and though physically benign and not contagious, Alopecia can have devastating effects on one’s mental, emotional, and social wellbeing — especially for children, young adults, and women.
  definition3: >
    There are three types of Alopecia — each completely unpredictable, with the potential for hair to fall out or regrow at any time. Alopecia Areata is patchy hair loss on the scalp; Alopecia Totalis is the loss of all hair on the head; and Alopecia Universalis is loss of all hair on the body.

      Having long, blonde hair all throughout his youth, Skylar was 
      diagnosed with Alopecia when he was 16 after finding a dime-sized bald spot on the back of his head.
      Six months later, Skylar had become completely bald—a unique look for a sophomore in high school. That uncontrolled transition took a toll on Skylar's emotional well-being and self-confidence throughout high school. 
      Over the past 9 years, Skylar has embraced his Alopecia and has learned to recognize it as an important
      part of his identity. He's also realized that many others like him are trying to overcome similar challenges. Now, Skylar is embarking on an adventure of a lifetime to demonstrate that Alopecia is not an inhibitor and to
      encourage other Alopecians to own their identity as well.

      Since going completely bald at age 19 due to Alopecia Areata, Kate has rocked a multitude of hairstyles from bald to buzz to curly bob. From a childhood with long curly hair and a competitive Irish Dancing career with a wig wearing requirement, Kate learned early on about societal pressures around appearance. Her journey to accept a lack of control over her hair, her self-image, and how others view her is a work in progress, but a fulfilling one. Due to the variability of Alopecia Areata over time, there may come a day when Kate (and many others like her) loses her hair again. Whether she’s bald or auditioning for a Pantene commercial, she is ultimately stronger and more self-confident having experienced Alopecia and hopes that the support offered by AFA will propel others like her to live life to the max.
