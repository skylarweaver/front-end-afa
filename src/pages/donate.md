  Thank you for supporting our lifechanging work.  


  Private donors cover our overhead operating costs so 100% of your donation will help Alopecians in need.  


  Your donation made here will <b>not</b> fund Skylar's travel, but rather you will fund sustainable support group events for people affected by Alopecia,
  help increase education of Alopecia to the public, and advance research to find a
  safe treatment for Alopecia. And your donation is 100% tax-deductible.  


  On behalf of Alopecians everywhere, we thank you for you support.
