# Adventures for Alopecia: Gatsby + Netlify CMS front-end

## What is Adventures for Alopecia? :motorcycle::dash::dash:

[Adventures for Alopecia](https://projectafa.org) (Project AFA) was a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization supporting children and adults living with Alopecia. We achieve our mission through three main program areas: support, awareness, and research.

**Support.** We host support group events throughout North America, Central America, and South America.  
**Awareness.** We educate the public about Alopecia through social media, press, word of mouth, and speaking engagements.  
**Research.** We contribute a portion of the funds we raise to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, an existing 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to discovering a cure for Alopecia.


After Skylar's inaugural Adventure for Alopecia, Project AFA will use donations to sponsor adventures for other Alopecians to regain their confidence through adventure and travel.

## What is this repo?

Here lies the front-end source code for AFA's website, which has two main components marketing/communications to inform the audience of our mission, and a donations portal to allow tax-deductable contributions to support people with Alopecia.

## Tech Stack

### Front-end

*Gatsby.* We use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to ensure our web app is preformant. 
*Netlify CMS.* We use a Gatsby plugin to implement Netlify CMS to allow GUI content updates while maintaining a static, preformant site.

### Backend

*Lambda.* [Our backend](https://github.com/skylarweaver/serverless-afa) runs entirely on serverless AWS Lambda functions to process all donations, load map content, and live-update Skylar's motorcycle coordinates.  
*Google Sheeets.* To serve our needs: a simple place to store data that can be viewed and manipulated by both tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy AFA board members, we use Google Sheets as our database.  

### Misc
*Stripe.* We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle all donations securely.  
*Estimote.* We use [Estimote's](https://estimote.com/) LTE Beacon which is installed into Skylar's Motorcycle to track the most recent location and update the map accordingly (after appropriate obfuscation).
